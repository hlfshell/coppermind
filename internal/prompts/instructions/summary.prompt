The following is a conversation contained. The user speaking is under the "user" attribute, and "content" is the message.
Reading this history, create a summary of the whole conversation in a single short setence and a few keywords.
To do this, respond in the format of "keyword 1, keyword 2, etc | a brief description".
Do not include any mention that it is a discussion or conversation, as all summaries will be part of a discussion. Focus purely on categorization of content
Do not mention any of the users in the conversation within the keywords
If you believe that the conversation is short and has no significance, report "none | none" and do not output anything else
Never respond with more than one *short* sentence, and try to keep keywords to just two or three comma delimited. Keywords should not be more than 2 words, usually one word.
The brief description should give a one sentence overview of what was discussed. It should be AS SHORT a sentence as possible, at most 12 words. Do not provide the names of the people talking unless the conversation is specifically about one of htem.
For instance, if the conversation is Keith asking you about robotics, a possible result you'd respond with is "robotics, kinematics, motion planning | how to kinematically plan a robot's arm motion". Note that I didn't mention Keith or Rose in the summary.
Aim to be succinct. If a conversation is short and contains nothing interesting, return the phrase "none | none".
